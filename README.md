# Advent22_Rust
Advent of Code 2022 with approx 0 previous rust experience

Using it to learn Rust, so experimenting with concepts that may not have been the fastets way for me to solve them personally.


Personal notes on topics i delved into:
- iterators
- String vs str
- HashSet
  - Reference intersect vs creating new hashmap and capturing ownership of input
- VecDeque to make a ringbuffer (i think that's what it is in memmory)
